React Native Starter Kit
=======
### 谨慎升级react-native，一路都是坑啊！！！

### Getting Started

1. Ensure you've followed the [React Native - Get Started Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for the platform/s of choice
2. Clone this project
3. Run `npm install` from root directory

### Run on iOS

1. Open the /ios/StarterKit.xcodeproj file in Xcode
2. Run in an iOS simulator by pressing the Play (triangle) icon at the top left

### Run on Android

1. Start an Android Simulator first - in terminal, type `android avd`. This will open the Android Virtual Device Manager. Select a device to open
2. Once it's running, in a new terminal tab/window, type `react-native run-android`

### Opening the Debug Menu

- **iOS**: CMD + D
- **Android**: CMD + M
